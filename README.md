the folder of "voicerecognition" is about the how to make text fiels to become  audio files.And the file of the head of 'U' is main file .
this file don't need other dependece ,but it need you have a python environment.And you need to acquire 'pyttsx3' and python_docx by pip order.
it is easy for to use it.And it is very good to make text files become audio filse.
finally , good luck to you!
